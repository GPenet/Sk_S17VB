V7 second version search of 17 clues in a solution grid

The first attempt to improve the 17 clues search has somehow been disappointing.
Meantime, some work has been done in the 18 clue search, benchmarking blue's DLL (blue: member of the new players forum, inventor of this process main principles)

This V7 version contains or is supposed to contain at the end


a) a built-in ED solution grids generators fitting the process needs
b) a quite new unavoidable sets generator mising brute force and known previous UA
c) a direct expansion of the Uas for bands 1+2 producingptential valid bands 1+2
d) a new way to take benefit of gangster uas having a socket of 2/3 cells in a mini row
e) a quite new way to use other uas with cells in band 3
f) a new process to fnish the job in band 3.

The proof that all 17 clues are knwn is over. This new version is not done to re run the proof. In fact, the target is to do the same for a 18 clues scan assumed to be the best way to flag all solution grids having one or more 18 clues as valid sudoku.

Testing a new 17 scan and extending the code to the 18 scan (not that different) seems the safer way to product a valid code.

I open this repository with a partial draft of the final code. As I start from a 18 clues scan made on a single solution grid, The main choices are frozen. 
Extendng and optimizing the code to the "17 clues scan mode" is not so simple. The final code is expected to be delivered end of 2022, may be later in 2023.  
Posting partial results secures what seems final. Comments will be written and released in parallel.
